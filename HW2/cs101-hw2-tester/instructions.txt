How to use tester:

Unzip the cs101-hw2-tester.zip file in the same directory as your hw2 code:

hw2/
  set.html
  set.js
  styles.css
  imgs/
  cs101-hw2-tester.zip
  cs101-hw2-tester/
    hw2-tests.js     (Testing functionality for HW2 Part B Requirements)
    index.html       (Testing page to run/view test output)       
    lolex.js         (UI testing library)      
    tester.css       (CSS for testing page output)      
    tester.js        (Functionality specific to tester) 

Then, open hw2/cs101-hw2-tester/index.html and upload your hw2/set.js file to run
the tests. These will also test some of the styling/functionality requirements 
from Part A.
